### About this repository

This is my personal nest of Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 Road to Boruto - Next Generations Modding documentation.

The tutorials found here are written by me, based on what I learn from sources such as video tutorials on Youtube.

Each source of information will be linked in the respective tutorials, and I'll keep a general list of credits in this README too.

I'll also keep clean copies of certain files in the [clean_files folder](clean_files).

Those are extracted from my copy of the game which has all the DLCs, game version 1.09.
