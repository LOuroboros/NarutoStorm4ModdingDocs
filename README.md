## Notice

As of today, 09 of March from 2022, I found out that someone has been impersonating me. Someone used my nickname in one of [EliteAce](https://www.youtube.com/c/EliteAce/videos)'s Youtube videos to mislead him and ban me from what's the biggest modding server for this game.

Thus, I decided to walk away and leave this modding community behind.

I feel sickened, disgusted. I have lost my desire to mod Naruto Storm 4, even though what I intended to do was a light modpack for my personal use.

The malicious being who impersonated me basically tried to force EliteAce to stop making paid mods or something along those lines.

I told this to Tetrable/Tetra/Typhonua, I said this in the [Naruto Storm Modding Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/brN9cZxAqm) before I was banned; from my own perspective, paid mods are a rather subjective matter.

I don't see as morally correct to create paid mods, and I am someone who would never pay for a mod either, but this mostly depends on each person and their own moral code, hence why I see it as something that is subjective.

Yet, someone used my nickname in an attempt to force EliteAce to stop creating paid mods.

I tried to reason with EliteAce, but it's impossible. I have 2 Youtube channels, and checking them against the monster who impersonated me should be good enough, but also, our ways of spelling messages using a keyboard are clearly, vastly different.

EliteAce wants me to apologize for the things that this person who wasn't me said, and my pride simply won't let me. I refuse to accept someone else's mistake as mine. If this was a friend, or a family member, perhaps it would be different.

Clearly, there is nothing that I can do to change his mind, and honestly, this just soured me completely.

I'm leaving this repository open though archived from now on.

### About this repository

This is my personal nest of Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 Road to Boruto - Next Generations Modding documentation.

The tutorials found here are written by me, based on what I learn from sources such as video tutorials on Youtube.

Each source of information will be linked in the respective tutorials, and I'll keep a general list of credits in this README too.

I'll also keep clean copies of certain files in the [clean_files folder](clean_files).

Those are extracted from my copy of the game which has all the DLCs, game version 1.09.
